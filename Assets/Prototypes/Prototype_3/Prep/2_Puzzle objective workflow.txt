1. Create the puzzle object
2. Attach DebugPlayerCameraRoot as a child entity. Position as you see fit on the camera viewport.
3. Disable the camera on DebugPlayerCameraRoot to see what it looks like with the split perspective camera (the actual cameras use the same settings)
4. Duplicate the puzzle object (with the child camera objects), and position the two pieces where you want them.
5. Unparent the perspective cameras. You can use this transform value for the objective point.
